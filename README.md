If you are reading this, then you must be curious as to where to start!

* If you just need to execute the script, then run `OR-568_Project_Analysis.r`.
* The full experience requires use of a Jupyter Notebook with an R kernel loaded.
* A version of the notebook can be viewed and executed on Colaboratory's sandbox [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Mes41JE52iLV0M9FmrQ7_K-0ifCUEh68#forceEdit=true&sandboxMode=true).

Otherwise, you can use the various scripts to condition the original `nyc-rolling-sales.csv` using the `Process-Address.ps1` script.
